### Alexander Pihl - 4. semester - Fullstack JavaScript
___

# Period-1 Vanilla JavaScript, Es-next, Node.js, Babel + Webpack and TypeScript-1

## Explain and Reflect:
___
### Explain the differences between Java and JavaScript + node. Topics you could include:
___
  - Java is a compiled language and JavaScript a scripted language.

  - Java is an object oriented programming language and JavaScript is an object based scripting language.

  - Java supports multithreading and JavaScript dont.

  - Java has a thread based approach to concurrenc where Javascript has event based approach to concurrency.

  - Java is a strongly typed language, which means that the user has to decide the data type of the variable before declaring and using it.
    Example an "int a" variable can only store the value of a type integer.

    JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that the user does not have to worry about the data-type of the variable before and after the declaration.
    Example a "var a" variable can store the value of any data-type.

  - **Blocking vs. non-blocking:**
    - Blocking refers to operations that block further execution until that operation finishes while non-blocking refers to code that doesn’t block execution. Java is a blocking type language where Javascript is not.

- **Explain generally about node.js, when it “makes sense” and npm, and how it “fits” into the node echo system.**
  - node.js is an open source server enviroment, runs on various platforms, uses JavaScript on the server and is a asynchronous programming language.
  - npm is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects and a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

- **Explain about the Event Loop in JavaScript, including terms like; blocking, non-blocking, event loop, callback queue and "other" API's. Make sure to include why this is relevant for us as developers.**
  - asd

- **What does it mean if a method in nodes API's ends with xxxxxxSync?**
  - asd

- **Explain the terms JavaScript Engine (name at least one) and JavaScript Runtime Environment (name at least two)**
  - asd

- **Explain (some) of the purposes with the tools Babel and WebPack and how they differ from each other. Use examples from the exercises.**
  - asd

### Explain using sufficient code examples the following features in JavaScript (and node)
___
- **Variable/function-Hoisting**
  - asd

- **this in JavaScript and how it differs from what we know from Java/.net.**
  - asd

- **Function Closures and the JavaScript Module Pattern**
  - asd

- **User-defined Callback Functions (writing functions that take a callback)**
  - asd

- **Explain the methods map, filter and reduce**
  - Map ( [Example ind code](https://github.com/AlexanderPihl/4sem-fullstack-flow1/blob/main/Week1-04-02-2021/exercises/2.js))
    - The map() method in JavaScript creates an array by calling a specific function on each element present in the parent array. Generally map() method is used to iterate over an array and calling function on every element of array.
  - Filter
    - asd
  - Reduce
    - asd

- **Provide examples of user-defined reusable modules implemented in Node.js (learnynode - 6)**
  - asd

- **Provide examples and explain the es2015 features: let, arrow functions, this, rest parameters, destructuring objects and arrays,   maps/sets etc.**
  - asd

- **Provide an example of ES6 inheritance and reflect over the differences between Inheritance in Java and in ES6.**
  - asd

- **Explain and demonstrate, how to implement event-based code, how to emit events and how to listen for such events**
  - asd

### ES6,7,8,ES-next and TypeScript
___
- **Provide examples with es-next, running in a browser, using Babel and Webpack**
  - asd

- **Explain the two strategies for improving JavaScript: Babel and ES6 + ES-Next, versus Typescript. What does it require to use these technologies: In our backend with Node and in (many different) Browsers**
  - asd

- **Provide examples to demonstrate the benefits of using TypeScript, including, types, interfaces, classes and generics**
  - asd

- **Explain how we can get typescript code completion for external imports.**
  - asd

- **Explain the ECMAScript Proposal Process for how new features are added to the language (the TC39 Process)**
  - asd

### Callbacks, Promises and async/await
___
**Explain about (ES-6) promises in JavaScript including, the problems they solve, a quick explanation of the Promise API and:**
  - asd

- **Example(s) that demonstrate how to implement our own promise-solutions.**
  - asd

- **Example(s) that demonstrate error handling with promises**
  - asd
  
- **Example(s) that demonstrate how to execute asynchronous (promise-based) code in serial or parallel**
  - asd

**Explain about JavaScripts async/await, how it relates to promises and reasons to use it compared to the plain promise API.**
  - asd

### Provide examples to demonstrate

- **Why this often is the preferred way of handling promise**
  - asd
  
-  **Error handling with async/await**
  - asd
  
- **Serial or parallel execution with async/await.**
  - asd
